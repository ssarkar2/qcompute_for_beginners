    "A qubit has a hidden spin state (described by a unit vector in R<sup>2</sup>). Because of the uncertainly principle, we cannot directly observe this state without changing it. When we measure it, we observe either \"0\" or \"1\" one of the states with a certain probability (given by teh direction of the measurement and the state of the Qubit).\n",

    "2. Create a Qubit, using the `Qubit` class\n",

Therefore whatever qubit Alice transmits will be either in state \\ket{a_0} or \\ket{a_1}. When she wants to send a 0, she sends a qubit that has been measured 0 (and thus has state \\ket{a_0}). Bob will measure it and get: $\\ket{a_0} = d_0\\ket{b_0} + d_1\\ket{b_1}$. Therefore with probability $d_0^2$, he will correctly read the 0 bit from Alice as 0.\n",

Thus in the $2n$ bits where Alice and Bob chose the same basis (after step 4 above), Eve will be right half the time (and all three will get the same bit), but the other times, she will change the qubit's state, and thus when Bob measures it he will only get the bit as Alice half the time.\n",
